        I live near an airport. I was with a couple of friends on the terrace
        the other day, and noticed how often planes fly over us. It was a Friday
        and thus, Pilane was born over the weekend. It was a joy to build. I'll
        post a more detailed write-up on my blog soon.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        <strong>How it works:</strong>
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          The primary camera is an old Android Nokia device. I pull the images
          from it using <code>adb</code> and <code>scrcpy</code>
        </li>
        <li>The images are copied to a Raspberry Pi running YOLOv11</li>
        <li>
          Flightradar API fetches the details about the aircraft and the flight
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        It ends up missing a few flights since inference on the Pi 3B+ takes
        about 2.5s per image, even when using the NCNN export of YOLOv11. I
        could upgrade the Pi but using an underpowered device is part of the
        fun, I really enjoyed the challenge.
      </p>

        <strong>Wishlist:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          Show some nice stats on the website (all images of a callsign, of an
          airline etc.)
        </li>
        <li>Identify fewer birds as planes üê¶</li>
      </ul>

      There's also a Telegram channel where the script posts the images: <a
