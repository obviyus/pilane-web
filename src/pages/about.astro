        I live quite close to an airport, I can see planes flying overhead all
        the time. I was on the terrace one day with a couple friends and was
        quite surprised by the number of planes that flew over us. It was a
        Friday and thus, Pi-lane was born. It was a joy to build this. You can
        find a more detailed write-up <a

        This project is heavily inspired by skybot.cam (RIP), but tries to be a
        bit more DIY without using an ADS-B receiver or a Cloud vision API.
      </p>

      <p class="my-4">
        <strong>How it works:</strong>
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          The camera is an old Android Nokia device. I pull the images from it
          using <code>adb</code> and <code>scrcpy</code>
        </li>
        <li>The images are copied to a Raspberry Pi running YOLOv11</li>
        <li>
          The Pythons script uses the Flightradar API fetches the details about
          the aircraft and the flight
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p class="my-4">
        You can find the script <a
          class="text-blue-500"
          href="https://gist.github.com/obviyus/86c693683ffee95c06d3c8d1177d394f"
          >here</a
        >.
      </p>

        It ends up missing a few flights since inference on the Pi 3B+ takes
        about 2.5s per image, even when using the NCNN export of YOLOv11. I
        could upgrade the Pi but using an underpowered device is part of the
        fun, I really enjoyed the challenge.

        <strong>Wishlist:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6">
        <li>
          Show some nice stats on the website (all images of a callsign, of an
          airline etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Purchase a RTL-SDR and use that instead of an API (completely self
          hosted!)
        </li>
        <li>Identify fewer birds as planes üê¶</li>

          class="w-96 mt-4 mx-auto object-cover"
        />
      </ul>

      There's also a Telegram channel where the script posts the images: <a
